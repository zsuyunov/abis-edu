# MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) - Currently Disabled

## Overview
All MFA functionality has been commented out and disabled. You can enable it later when needed.

## What Was Disabled

### 1. Login Route (`src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`)
- ✅ MFA import commented out
- ✅ MFA code parameter extraction commented out
- ✅ All MFA verification logic commented out (lines 253-294)

### 2. MFA Service (`src/lib/security/mfa.ts`)
- ✅ Entire implementation commented out
- ✅ Placeholder methods that throw errors (to prevent accidental use)
- ✅ Instructions added for enabling MFA

### 3. MFA API Endpoints (`src/app/api/auth/mfa/setup/route.ts`)
- ✅ All endpoints return 503 (Service Unavailable)
- ✅ Original code preserved in comments for future use

### 4. Validation Schemas (`src/lib/security/validation.ts`)
- ✅ `mfaCode` field commented out in `loginSchema`
- ✅ `mfaSetupSchema` commented out
- ✅ `mfaVerifySchema` commented out

## Database Fields (Still Active)
These MFA-related fields remain in the database schema and are safe to keep:
- `mfaEnabled` (Boolean, defaults to false)
- `mfaSecret` (String, nullable)

They won't cause any issues and will be ready when you enable MFA later.

## How to Enable MFA Later

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install speakeasy @types/qrcode
```

### Step 2: Uncomment Code Files

**A. MFA Service** (`src/lib/security/mfa.ts`)
- Remove the placeholder class
- Uncomment the full MFA implementation

**B. Login Route** (`src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`)
- Uncomment the `MFAService` import (line 18)
- Uncomment the `mfaCode` extraction (line 69)
- Uncomment the MFA verification block (lines 256-293)

**C. MFA Setup API** (`src/app/api/auth/mfa/setup/route.ts`)
- Remove the disabled endpoint handlers
- Uncomment the full MFA setup implementation

**D. Validation Schemas** (`src/lib/security/validation.ts`)
- Uncomment `mfaCode` in `loginSchema`
- Uncomment `mfaSetupSchema`
- Uncomment `mfaVerifySchema`

### Step 3: Test MFA
1. Use an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator)
2. Call `POST /api/auth/mfa/setup` to generate QR code
3. Scan QR code with authenticator app
4. Call `PUT /api/auth/mfa/setup` with TOTP code to verify
5. Test login with MFA enabled

### Step 4: Security Considerations
- MFA is currently only available for Admin and Teacher accounts
- Backup codes should be generated and securely stored
- Consider implementing account recovery flow
- Test MFA thoroughly before rolling out to production

## Why MFA Was Disabled
- Reduces complexity during initial deployment
- Allows you to focus on core security features first
- MFA can be added incrementally when ready
- All infrastructure is in place for quick enablement

## Current Security Status Without MFA
Even without MFA, your system has strong security:
- ✅ Argon2 password hashing
- ✅ JWT with short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- ✅ Rotating refresh tokens (7 days)
- ✅ Rate limiting on login
- ✅ Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- ✅ Security event logging
- ✅ Token versioning for global session invalidation
- ✅ Secure cookie flags (httpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict)
